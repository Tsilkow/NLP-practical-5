\section{Neural Implementation }
\subsection*{e) Training and testing}
After 15 epochs of training, following scores were achieved in testing:
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{llll}
  Method & BLEU & Inform rate & Success rate \\
  Greedy & 0.236 & 95.92\% & 56.12\% \\
  Beam & 0.239 & 96.94\% & 56.12\% \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection*{f) Softmax Policy}
After implementing softmax policy and then training it for 15 epochs, following scores were achieved in testing:
\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{tabular}{llll}
  Method & BLEU & Inform rate & Success rate \\
  Greedy & 0.216 & 96.94\% & 45.92\% \\
  Beam & 0.215 & 96.94\% & 44.90\% \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\\
Although inform rate is slighty higher (and was trained faster), success rate is significantly lower when compared to default policy.

\subsection*{g) BLEU score as sole evaluation metric for dialogues}
When BLEU metric is used in translation evaluation, it suffers from
lack of checking for meaning and verifying the structure. In dialogue system,
these problems are made worse, as we put more emphasis on integrity and
coherence, especially when were trying to pass off as a human.
If BLEU is used as a sole evaluation metric, results are more likely to
have all the right components, but appear intensly unhuman, ruining the flow
of conversation.
